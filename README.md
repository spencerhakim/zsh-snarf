# zsh-snarf
Snarf theme for [Oh-My-Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/). Designed with dark terminal themes in mind (particularly Monokai, but
Solarized works, too). Requires the `battery` and `jsontools` plugins, and a
[Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) typeface with Font Awesome, Devicons, and Powerline symbols patched
in (using a "Nerd Font Complete" variation is probably the easiest way to go).

### Installation
```bash
zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/spencerhakim/zsh-snarf/master/install.sh)"
```

This will not modify any settings; it only simplifies installation. It places the font and .zsh-theme in the appropriate
directories, and imports the iTerm2 preset. You are still required to switch to these files manually.
